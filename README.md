# üêπ‚öôÔ∏è CDKTF + Libvirt + Go

A project that combines **[CDK for Terraform (CDKTF)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf)** with **Go** and the **Libvirt provider** to provision and manage virtual machines (VMs) locally on Linux.

## üìñ Overview
This project lets you define and deploy virtual machines using **Go code + YAML configuration**.  

Think of it as **Infrastructure as Code**, but with the flexibility of Go and the power of Terraform.  
I created this project to create my own test and training environment faster and easier. If needed, you can define the specifications of the machines you want, such as:
- their number
- hardware resources
- base image

in the **config.yml** file.

There is also an option for when you need an experimental environment very quickly, you can put the number of machines in the **count** variable so that cdktf creates the same number of machines with the default variables and fills the file with the machine specifications.
